# Fraud Detection Project – Adey Innovations Inc.

This project builds machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in e-commerce and banking data. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and explainability using SHAP.

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/`: Google Colab notebook with full workflow
- `reports/`: Final report with insights and model evaluation


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the Colab notebook
2. Upload the datasets (`Fraud_Data.csv`, `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`)
3. Run cells step-by-step

## 📊 Models Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- XGBoost (best-performing)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- F1-Score
- Precision-Recall
- Confusion Matrix

## 🔍 Explainability
SHAP plots used to interpret model predictions.
